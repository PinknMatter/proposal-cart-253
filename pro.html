            Fry-Day is a 2D egg cooking game. The game focuses on the idea of cooperatively trying to fry an egg. Fry-day will be incredibly hard, almost impossible to complete. The controls will be very sensitive and even the slightest movement can mess everything up. The game consists of three stages; prep, cooking and plating; each consisting of a different challenge. In the prep stage, players must crack an egg without breaking the yolk, in the cooking stage players must cook the egg without burning or letting it stick, and finally in the plating stage players must plate the egg without dropping it. Each player has control over one hand, and if one player is too far apart from the other, they'll be pulled back, dropping whatever they are holding. Any mistakes will compound, and if the players move too fast, it increases the probability for things to go wrong. The players will receive a score based on their performance, with high scores being stored on the server. If done properly, the game can be beaten in only a few minutes, but only if the players take their time and work together. The end goal of Fry-Day is to challenge the users in ways they have not seen before, forcing the players to take their time and work in sync.         </div>

            Fry-Day will encourage a fun, yet stressful environment for the players. Once booted up, players will be greeted by a slick menu, with happy music and little characters smiling; making the game seem simple and relaxing. The game quickly destabilizes the players by subverting expectations with the immense difficulty of the game. Fry-Day will be against the player, doing everything in its power to make sure they do not complete the game. As the difficulty increases the music will become more dissonant and the happy vibe will disappear, but if the players make little to no mistakes, the vibe will become happy again. The game purposely upsets the users, creating arguments and frustration with an ultimate aim to improve friendship and collaboration between the players. When players begin and finish a game, they're asked to input their stress level, which is stored on the server and graphed. It's assumed the more rounds two players play together, the lower their stress scores will be.We find most people are panicked, in a rush, and never take their time. Fry-Day comments on this mindset and shows how rushing and overworking yourself can actually make you less productive.

            Fry-Day challenges players to be calm, precise, and coordinated. Teaching players to take things slow and think about the end goal instead of just short term fixes. An example would be when a player tries to crack an egg with one hand, they risk breaking the yolk; yet if both players crack it together, the risk is significantly lower. If a player tries to plate the egg by themselves, there's a huge risk of it flying off the pan, when both players work together the risk is lower. In both of these examples, teamwork makes it easier. Another example is how the game seems like you need to work fast, from the fast music and ambience of the game; but you don't actually have to. If the player tries to cook the egg faster by increasing the heat, the bottom of the egg will burn and the top will be raw. Players need to do things properly because Fry-Day purposely has no shortcuts. This aims to teach the player that they should take their time and not try to find cheap ways of doing things.        </div>

            <h1>Overcooked</h1>
            <p>Overcooked is “a chaotic couch co-op cooking game for one to four players”. The players must cook and serve different orders to various guests. The game has very simple controls but is incredible hard to be good at. The players must find a team who can communicate and co-operate well with each other. Overcooked is all about teamwork and communication. Much like Fry-Day, Overcooked encourages arguments and fights between players. A review reads “i now hate my friend and they dont want to talk to me anymore, 10/10 love it.” Other reviews read the game as, “the most stressful game ever” and “prepare to hate your friends”. Though this game breeds a harmful environment the game is rated extremely highly and is loved by millions of players. Fry-Day will be very similar, though not as refined, will take the same approach and breed an enviroment of stress, arguments and fights between friends.</p>

            <h1>Cuphead</h1>
            <p>Cuphead is a extremely popular classic run and gun action game. The game takes the look of childish visuals and audios inspired from the 1930s. All of Cuphead is hand drawn and hand made.The game game be played single-player or co-op. Cuphead is extremely difficult, almost impossible to complete. The game is centered around battling bosses and moving on to the next level which is progressively harder. Some reviews read, “This game is made by the devil itself!”, “game too hard I couldnt pass the tutorial”. With a childlike look but an impossibly hard game Cuphead is similar to the way Fry-day will look and work. </p>

            <h1>Surgeon Simulator</h1>
            <p>Surgeon Simulator is a first person 3D simulator where the player performs various surgeries as a surgeon. Though Surgeon Simluator is called a sim. The game is very different that actually performing surgery. The game never works as you intend. Each finger is separately controlled by a different keyboard button making it impossible to actually control. The inconsistency of being able to grip objects leads to some infuriating gameplay. The game lacks polish, with items clipping through your hand, and all sorts of different bugs. The game does this on purpose to infurate the player even more. </p>

            <h1>How it's different</h1>
            <p2>Fry-day will take inspiration from Overcooked's chaotic environment, Cuphead’s extreme difficulty and Surgeon Simulator’s inconsistency. The unique combination of these three components is what makes Fry-day different. In modern gaming it is all about graphics, polishness, and difficulty with near pixel perfect imagery and little to no bugs. We aim to make Fry-day as a somewhat "anti-game" by intentionally breaking all fundamentals of modern gaming; making it different yet refreshing.
