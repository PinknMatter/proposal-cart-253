            Fry-Day will encourage a stressful, fun, and annoying environment. The game will have a front that it looks extremely easy, it will give the look of a childs game. Like not judging a book by its cover, Fry-Day will not be as it seems. The game will be against the player, doing everything in its power to make sure they do not complete the game.  The game will upset the users, create arguments and frustration on purpose. Fry-Day will take the relationship between the users to the test.

            <h1>Overcooked</h1>
            <p>Overcooked is “a chaotic couch co-op cooking game for one to four players”. The players must cook and serve different orders to various guests. The game has very simple controls but is incredible hard to be good at. The players must find a team who can communicate and co-operate well with each other. Overcooked is all about teamwork and communication. Much like Fry-Day, Overcooked encourages arguments and fights between players. A review reads “i now hate my friend and they dont want to talk to me anymore, 10/10 love it.” Other reviews read the game as, “the most stressful game ever” and “prepare to hate your friends”. Though this game breeds a harmful environment the game is rated extremely highly and is loved by millions of players. Fry-Day will be very similar, though not as refined, will take the same approach and breed an enviroment of stress, arguments and fights between friends.</p>

            <h1>Cuphead</h1>
            <p>Cuphead is a extremely popular classic run and gun action game. The game takes the look of childish visuals and audios inspired from the 1930s. All of Cuphead is hand drawn and hand made.The game game be played single-player or co-op. Cuphead is extremely difficult, almost impossible to complete. The game is centered around battling bosses and moving on to the next level which is progressively harder. Some reviews read, “This game is made by the devil itself!”, “game too hard I couldnt pass the tutorial”. With a childlike look but an impossibly hard game Cuphead is similar to the way Fry-day will look and work. </p>

            <h1>Surgeon Simulator</h1>
            <p>Surgeon Simulator is a first person 3D simulator where the player performs various surgeries as a surgeon. Though Surgeon Simluator is called a sim. The game is very different that actually performing surgery. The game never works as you intend. Each finger is separately controlled by a different keyboard button making it impossible to actually control. The inconsistency of being able to grip objects leads to some infuriating gameplay. The game lacks polish, with items clipping through your hand, and all sorts of different bugs. The game does this on purpose to infurate the player even more. </p>
